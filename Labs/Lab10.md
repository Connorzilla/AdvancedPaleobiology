# Photogrammetry

Photogrammetry is a fairly simple process that combines multiple 2D photos into a 3D model. In paleontology, photogrammetry is used by museum curators to build 3D models of specimens in their collections, by researchers to study mophology in three dimensions, and by field scientists to create virtual models and maps of field sites. And while photogrammetry has been around for a while, people are rapidly developing new and exciting applications for the process. Learning the basics of photogrammetry will add a useful tool to your paleo research toolkit.
