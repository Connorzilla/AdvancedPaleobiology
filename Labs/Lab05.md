## Pre-Lab Reading Assignment

Before getting started on this lab, please read [Webster & Sheets (2010) *A Practical Introduction to Landmark-Based Geometric Morphometrics*](https://geosci.uchicago.edu/~mwebster/Webster_and_Sheets_2010.pdf), which will provide an overview of the applications of morphometrics in paleontology and an introduction to the methods we will practice in this lab.

## Part 1: Osteostracans Landmark Data Collection

From the [*Tree of Life*](http://tolweb.org/Osteostraci)

The Osteostraci, or osteostracans, are a major clade (about 200 species) of fossil, armored jawless vertebrates which lived from the Early Silurian (about 430 million years) to the Late Devonian (about 370 million years). Most of them have a characteristic horseshoe-shaped head, which consists of a massive endoskeletal skull, covered with a shield of dermal bone. On the dorsal surface of the head are the closely-sat eyes, a pineal foramen, and a medium, keyhole-shaped nasophypophysial openening. In addition, there are peculiar "fields" (in fact, depressions of the braincase, covered with loose platelets of dermal bone), which have been regarded as either sense organs or electric organs. The mouth and gill openings are, like the Galeaspida, situated on the ventral side of the head. Osteostracans also have large, pad-shaped paired fins. Most osteostracans are about 20 to 40 cm in total length, but some species could be extremely small (about 4 cm in length). The largest species was about one meter in length.
