# Introduction to the Paleobiology Database

*This lab is based on the [Lab Exercise 3](https://github.com/aazaff/teachPaleobiology/blob/master/LabExercise3.md) for [teachPaleobiology](https://github.com/aazaff/teachPaleobiology)

## Instructions

Complete the following lab exercise and submit your answers as a GitHub markdown file to your personal GitHub repository by February, 14, 2019. Post a link to the file in the Lab 07 Assignment on Canvas.

## Finding the Paleobiology Database

The URL for the Paleobiology Database (PDBD) is [www.paleobiodb.org](https://paleobiodb.org/). Open the PBDB in another web brower window. The first thing you should see is the **SPLASH** page:

The PBDB splash page has a lot of information packed into it. At the bottom of the screen, you will see some basic stats on the types and quantity of data located in the database.

**Data Type** | **Definition**
------------- | --------------
**References** | Scientific articles, books, monographs, or other data sources
**Taxa** | A taxon (plural: taxa) is a group of one or more populations of an organism or organisms seen by taxonomists to form a unit
**Opinions** | Different opinions on the correct taxonomic name/identification of different fossil taxa
**Collections** | A group (collection) of fossil taxa at a specific location
**Occurences** | An individual observation of a taxon at a specific location
**Scientists** | The number of scientists that are *officially* involved in the PBDB initiative

## References

All data in the PBDB can ultimately be traced back to one or more references. You can search through references in the PBDB using the **Search** menu at the top of the spash page. Select `Search > Published references` to navigate to the reference search form.
