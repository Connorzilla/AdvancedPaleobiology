## The Most Basic Concepts of R

Throughout this tutorial there will be references to **objects** and **functions**. These are the two fundamental units of the
R programming language. R stores information as objects and uses functions to interact with the objects. The following quote (not mine) summarizes the relationship quite well.

“Everything that **exists** in R is an object.
Everything that you **do** in R is a function.”

The line between objects and functions can become somewhat blurred because all functions are stored as objects and all objects 
can only be interacted with via functions. Don't be discouraged by this complexity, just remember the above quote and you will be fine.

## Why should you use R?

If you are feeling overwhelmed by what you are learning or doing in R, never forget that everything you do in R is just a 
**function** designed for one of the four following purposed. Determine which step you are trying to perform, and proceed from there.
