# GitHub Tutorial for Advanced Paleobiology

For this course, you will be required to submit your tests and labs as GitHub markdown sheets. We will create GitHub accounts and course repositories together on the first day of class, and then you can refer back to this page as needed.

## Getting Started in GitHub

After you have created your GitHub account, you need to create a **repository** for your course files. We will do this together in class, but if you want to create another repository in the future, use these steps.

1. From your profile page, click the "Repositories" tab, which will take you to a page that displays all your existing repositories.
2. Click the green "New" button in the upper right part of the page. This will take you to a new page called ***Create a new repository***
3. Choose a name and write a short description. Decide if you want your repository to be public or private (private is only allowed if you have a paid account).
4. Check the "Initialize this repository with a README" option.
5. Click the green **Create repository** button.

And you're done!

## Creating a New Markdown Sheet

To create a new Markdown sheet in your repository, simply click the **Create new file** button near the top of your repository. This will take you to a new, blank page. Give it a name in the Markdown format (filename.md) and start typing.

Be sure to commit the the new file to your repository before you navigate away from this page, or your work will not be saved. To do this, click the green **Commit new file** button at the very bottom of the page.

As you make changes to your Markdown sheet, you can add descriptions to clarify what you did. This can be helpful when you're working on something complicated or if you're collaborating with other people.

## Writing in Markdown

Markdown sheets use their own language. Luckily, it's a pretty intuitive and easy to learn. GitHub has a great resource sheet called [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) that you can refer to for most common formatting needs.

## Creating Folders in Your Repository

Organizing your files in your GitHub repository is a little less intuitive. You can't just click and drag like you do in Google Drive.

If you want to create a new folder, you have to use a Markdown sheet to do so. Open the Markdown sheet that you would like to move into a new folder. Click on the filename near the top of the page. For example, this page's title is `AdvancedPaleobiology/GitTutorial.md`. When you click on the title, it will become editable. Use slashes to create the name of the new folder. So, if I want a new folder called "Tutorials", I would type `\Tutorials\` before `GitTutorial.md`. This automatically creates the new folder and places this file in it.
