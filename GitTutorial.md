# GitHub Tutorial for Advanced Paleobiology

For this course, you will be required to submit your tests and labs as GitHub markdown sheets. We will create GitHub accounts and course repositories together on the first day of class, and then you can refer back to this page as needed.

## Getting Started in GitHub

After you have created your GitHub account, you need to create a **repository** for your course files. We will do this together in class, but if you want to create another repository in the future, use these steps.

1. From your profile page, click the "Repositories" tab, which will take you to a page that displays all your existing repositories.
2. Click the green "New" button in the upper right part of the page. This will take you to a new page called ***Create a new repository***
3. Choose a name and write a short description. Decide if you want your repository to be public or private (private is only allowed if you have a paid account).
4. Check the "Initialize this repository with a README" option.
5. Click the green **Create repository** button.

And you're done!
