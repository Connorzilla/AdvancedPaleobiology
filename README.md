# Geology 497Q/597Q - Advanced Paleobiology

This repository contains course materials and information for the Advanced Paleobiology course at Western Washington University. Additional materials may be posted on the course Canvas site. 

This course is taught by Dr. Robyn Mieko Dahl. 

## Programs, etc, Required For This Course

This course emphasizes quantitative paleobiology research methods and therefore requires you to have access to the following programs. I recommend you download R Studio to your personal laptop, if possible, so that you can work on the same machine throughout the quarter. The computers in the Geology Department's geophysics lab (ES 213) also have all the following programs. While most of the programs required for this course are free to download and use, AgiSoft Photoscan is quite expensive so you should plan to use that program on the department's computers.

+ [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com) - an integrated development environment for R
+ [GitHub Repository](https://github.com) - you will need your own GitHub account and a repository for this course. We will set this up on the first day of class.
+ [FIJI](https://fiji.sc) - "FIJI is just ImageJ," a program we will use to collect landmark data
+ [AgiSoft Photoscan](http://www.agisoft.com) - photogrammetry software for building 3D models
